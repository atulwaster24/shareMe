<h4>What is Sanity and what is Sanity CMS? </h4>
<p>CMS stands for Content Management System. Sanity CMS does the job of managing your content for you while making it easy for you to fetch data from their api. It basically does the job of a database and also deployment of that backend for you. If provides some great features and quick querying feature to fetch and send the required data to the frontend.

<h1>Installation</h1>

This is the front-end part of the project. There is another repository on my git which is for the back-end code (ShareMe backend). Fork/Clone both the repositories and run npm i in each repository.
